<h3># Ontology structure<h3>
The NFDI MatWerk Ontology (MWO) is a domain-level ontology designed to enhance data integration and retrieval, fostering collaboration and improving knowledge representation across MSE domains. It covers essential aspects of MSE research data, including the NFDI-MatWerk community structure, key NFDI resources, services, and MSE-related research data description. By enabling the integration of diverse data sources and supporting complex research data workflows, MWO bridges MSE research metadata with concepts from upper-level ontologies.


<h3>## Reused upper-level ontologies<h3>
Building the mwo based on standardized upper-level ontologies provides a well-designed and standardized semantic structure, ensuring clear definitions of entities and their relationships. These ontologies enhance interoperability across different domains, support ontology development, and promote consistency in knowledge representation. The following upper-level ontologies have been incorporated for mwo development:  
- Basic Formal Ontology (BFO 2020) [?]: BFO was selected as the top-level ontology due to its well-structured design, broad applicability, and ability to integrate with various ontologies. As a foundational framework, BFO provides abstract, cross-domain semantic structures, ensuring comprehensive integration and compliance with top-level ontology standards. Its adherence to the ISO/IEC 21838-2 standard [?] further enhances interoperability in developed ontologies, facilitating knowledge representation, data exchange, and interdisciplinary collaboration.   
- NFDIcore ontology (v3): As a mid-level ontology, NFDIcore plays a central role in structuring and integrating research data across consortia. NFDIcore features a modular structure for improved interoperability among NFDI consortia. It provides a shared vocabulary that represents both the organizational structure of the NFDI and the diverse datasets contributed by project partners. The ontology encompasses key concepts such as organizations, consortia, projects, datasets, research outputs, geographical locations, and technical standards. These structured representations enable efficient data management, integration, and reuse across disciplines [?].  
- Platform MaterialDigital Core Ontology (PMDco v3): The Platform MaterialDigital core ontology (PMDco) is a mid-level ontology in the MSE domain. The PMDco provides bridging mid-level concepts for detailed description of processes, experiments, and computational workflows enabling the reproducibility of process and materials data. These general MSE concepts are designed to be extendable for specific applications within application ontologies. The PMDco is designed in a collaborative effort within the MaterialDigital initiative and intended to be easily used by MSE domain experts [?].   
- Other reused ontologies and vocabularies like Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) [?], Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Types (QUDT) ontology [?], Software Ontology (SWO) [?], Friend of a Friend (FOAF) [?], Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) [?], and schema.org vocabulary [?].
